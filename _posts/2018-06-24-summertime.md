Well this is my fist post on this page. I don't really have much to talk about right now. In my free time I have been watching World Cup games. My all-time favorite team is Brazil. However, I also like to root for other teams that haven't had a chance to win a World Cup yet. So far, I'm also supporting Portugal and Nigeria. Another team I'm keeping a close eye on is Japan. They have been doing a great job so far. I'll probably post again soon with some non-coding, soccer related stuff as the tournament continues.
