## About

I have a long history working with HTML and CSS to create websites for clients. I am also highly efficient at using WordPress. I am taking a few online courses this summer to become a more advanced coder. I hope to learn enough to make an interesting web app, and maybe more! 

I'm from sunny California and my hobbies are working with computers or cars. I also like to game on Steam from time to time. As you can probably guess, my favorite food is sushi! Ramen is a close second though!
